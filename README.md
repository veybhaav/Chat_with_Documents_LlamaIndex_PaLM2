# Chat_with_Documents_LlamaIndex_PaLM2
Project Overview
This project enables users to chat with documents using LlamaIndex and PaLM2. The system extracts information from documents, processes it, and facilitates an interactive question-answering environment. The project is designed for document comprehension and information retrieval in a natural conversational format.

Features
LlamaIndex Integration: Utilizes LlamaIndex to index and manage document content.
PaLM2 Model: Employs Google’s PaLM2 model for conversational responses based on document content.
Multi-format Support: Accepts various document types (PDF, Word, etc.) for indexing and querying.
User-friendly Interface: Simplified interactive environment to ask questions and receive accurate responses from indexed documents.
Prerequisites
Ensure the following dependencies are installed before proceeding with the setup:

Python 3.x
LlamaIndex
PaLM2 API Key
Document processing libraries (e.g., PyPDF2, docx, etc.)
Install the required Python libraries using:

bash
Copy code
pip install llama-index google-palm2 pypdf2 python-docx
Project Setup
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
cd Chat_with_Documents_LlamaIndex_PaLM2
Install Dependencies: Install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure API Keys: Add your PaLM2 API key in a .env file or directly in the code where the API is initialized:

bash
Copy code
export PALM2_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
Indexing Documents: Use the provided script to index documents using LlamaIndex:
